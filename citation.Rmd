# About this piece

I demonstrate inclusion of citations of `R` packages and/or external sources of literature within an `Rmarkdown` file in `R` [@R-base]. Some of the packages include `tidyverse` version `r packageVersion('tidyverse')` [@R-tidyverse]. I also used external citations which are not packages [_sensu_ @naimi2016sdm, pp.3; @naimi2014positional]. Similarly, Naimi [-@naimi2016sdm] showed that predictor variables should be scaled to ease interpretation of the variable importance values. @soberon2004biodiversity [pp. 25] had shown similar patterns in their earlier works.

Other important literature for `sdm` include those of [@zurell2020standard]. This is important especially for the reproducibility of the `sdm` or `enm` process. Zurell [-@zurell2020standard] showed that `enm` process can be done in a manner that allows for reproducibility. The work on citing biodiversity occurrence data is also well articulated [@owens2021occcite]. Owens and Rahbeck [-@owens2023volumodel] have also brought in interesting aspects of modeling into third dimension especially for marine species. These works are making handling modern `sdm` more interesting and creating new opportunities for furthering research.
